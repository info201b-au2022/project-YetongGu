**Project title**: Digging Deeper into Climate Change


**Authors**: _Leah S, Yetong G, Simon X, Maggie L_


**Affiliation**: INFO-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics - The Information School - University of Washington


**Date**: October 28 2022


**Abstract**: Climate change is rapidly changing and it’s happening now. The environment is at risk and it is being harmed. The environment is shifting and is being affected in all parts of the world. A change needs to be made, or else it might be too late to go back. Humans have become overly consumed and it is very prevalent in our environments. The overconsumption of waste, water, and fossil fuels (coal etc.) has harmed the environment. The United States is one of the most leading countries in overconsumption. If our consumption in all aspects doesn’t reduce, we might be at risk for future catastrophes.

**Introduction**: Our project will be focused on how climate change can change the earth surface temperature. We will be looking at data from researches that shows what are the potential causes to climate change; what plays the biggest factor that causes climate change. This project allows us to intuitively see what the impacts are and what can we do to reduce the change.


**Problem Domain**:

-   Project framing: The goal of this project is to develop a preliminary understanding of current environmental temperatures, analyze The analysis and investigation of how humans affect the environment and the causes of specific environmental impacts. Inspired by: [Beyond Catastrophe A New Climate Reality Is Coming Into View](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/26/magazine/climate-change-warming-world.html)

-   Human Values: Environmental problems, especially temperature problems, are one of the major problems in human society nowadays. This project will give us a preliminary knowledge of the current state of the environment, so that we can form a proper awareness of environmental protection.

-   Direct stakeholders: Environmental scientists, environmentalists who want to understand the current state of the environment. Students.

-   Indirect stakeholders: Citizens of society

-   Benefits: Raise citizens' awareness of the current state of the environment. Analyze as well as look for the main causes of ambient temperature changes.

-   Harms: The reasons searched for are not necessarily beneficial to the development of society.


**Research Questions**:
1. Can our data prove global warming and climate change are happening around the world? (We can look at the temperature changes around the globe to decide if there are climate change taking place.)

2. How does our data shows the temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere? (It could be specific described in certain time period.)

3. What are the impacts of CO2 emissions on temperature? (Does the emissions of CO2 cause an increase in temperature? If so, how can we reduce the emissions of CO2?)


**The Dataset**:

1.  By addressing the Climate Change issue we mainly focused on whether global warming is happening. Our dataset contains information like the average temperature of each month from 1850 to 2013 and corresponding to different locations with their Latitude and Longitude. Our second data set includes the information of each yea's total CO2 emissions of different countries from 1990 to 2018. The analyze of these information can support us to answer our research questions. For example, the temperature change trend in a specific time period can be obtained by processing the temperature feature, and by adding regional restrictions we can have the temperature change trend in different regions. Finally, the relationship between temperature change and carbon dioxide emission can be obtained by comparing the trend of temperature change and carbon dioxide emission.

4. We found all our our dateset from Kaggle an online community platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. And by searching further we learned that our “”GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity" and “GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity” datasets come from website **Berkeley Earth** and "historical_emissions" dataset comes from website **Climate Watch**.

	Berkeley Earth is an independent U.S. non-profit organization focused on environmental data science. Based on the global warming situation, they believe that “The need for quality, unbiased scientific information about global warming could not be more urgent.” Therefore Berkeley Earth supplies comprehensive open -source world air pollution data and highly user-accessible global temperature data that is timely, impartial, and verified. From this foundation, they further question and investigate the nature of relationships between this data and timely human and environmental issues, such as ocean temperature and acidification. They communicate outcomes in peer-reviewed journals, global print and digital media, at conferences, and on their website.

	Climate Watch is an online platform designed to empower people with the open climate data, visualizations and resources they need to gather insights on national and global progress on climate change. This free platform enables users to create and share custom data visualizations and comparisons of national climate commitments. It contributes to the goals of the Paris Agreement by using open data to increase transparency and accountability and providing actionable analysis on how countries can enhance their efforts to combat climate change.

  Climate Watch is based on data sources that are:

  -   Officially reported by national governments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or gathered by reputable institutions and research organizations.

  -   Well-documented with a methodology that includes rigorous quality checks and data validation.

  -   Available for the majority of countries and updated on a regular basis.

  -   Publicly available.


**Expected Implications**: Our expectation is that the data analysis results confirm that the world is indeed experiencing climate change, especially the trend of global warming is very obvious and there is a relationship between the increase in temperature and carbon dioxide emissions. Through this result, we hope that people can pay more attention to the deteriorating situation of the environment and try their best to protect the environment. It is also hoped that relevant personnel can notice the factors that leading to temperature changes and the trend of the speed of environment deterioration are increasing rapidly, then formulate corresponding policies to slow down the speed of climate change according to different situation.


**Limitations**: I think the limitation of our study is the incompleteness of the data, because each country has its own weather station, and the weather stations in different regions may have slightly different data. Realistically, it is not practical to obtain and analyze meteorological data on a large scale, so we will use data that have been slightly disaggregated to facilitate a desired result. Another point is that we, as students, may not be able to consider enough aspects and may miss some reasons for the biased results.
